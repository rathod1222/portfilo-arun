      `Version Control: Tools like Git and GitHub help manage code versions and enable collaboration among team members.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or CircleCI help automate the build, test, and deployment process, ensuring faster delivery and feedback loops.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Tools like Terraform and Ansible are used to provision and manage infrastructure using code, allowing environments to be easily replicated and maintained.

Containers: Docker is commonly used to create lightweight, portable containers that package applications and their dependencies, making them easy to deploy across various environments.

Orchestration: Kubernetes is widely used for orchestrating containers, ensuring scalability, availability, and self-healing capabilities of applications.

Monitoring and Logging: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) are used for monitoring applications and infrastructure, collecting logs, and visualizing system performance.

Configuration Management: Chef, Puppet, or Ansible help manage configurations across servers and ensure they are consistent and compliant.

Cloud: Platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud provide scalable infrastructure and services to host and manage applications.`,
